#+title: TRAMP-yadm

=tramp-yadm= adds an Emacs [[http://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]] method for accessing your [[https://yadm.io][yadm]] dotfiles. This
package adds support for [[http://magit.vc][magit]] and [[https://projectile.mx][projectile]] as well.

* Installation
For [[http://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]] users, just add to your config,

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! tramp-yadm
  :recipe (:host github :repo "seanfarley/tramp-yadm"))
#+end_src

Otherwise, do the =load-path= and =require= dance. If you want to speed up magit by
having it not recursive list untracked files from your home directory, you'll
need to call =tramp-yadm-register=. For example, I use the following,

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! tramp-yadm
  :defer t
  :init
  (after! magit
    (tramp-yadm-register)))
#+end_src

* Usage

Open your =yadm= dotfiles files by prepending =/yadm::~=.to the file, or by adding
this snippet to your config.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'projectile-known-projects "/yadm::~")
#+end_src
